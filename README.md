The project attached includes a MATLAB program that reads two of the four columns in each of the files named "trial", one responsible for displacement and the other for signal strength. Each "trial"file represents the movement of a mass on a spring and the main program captures the response in each one, plots it, and labels the peaks. The code also derives all vibrational parameters that are used to estimate the mass in each trial, which is then averaged.
